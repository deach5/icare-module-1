    <p>A woman in her 30s is standing in a gallery. She has long blonde hair and is wearing a black top and white jacket. She is shown from the chest up and is looking straight at you. She has an angry expression on her face.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>No, I&rsquo;m not gonna check in. It&rsquo;s a complete waste of my time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>She gestures towards herself, then points at you and leans towards you as she speaks, exaggerating her facial movements as she says each word.&nbsp;</p>

    </div>
</div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>She quickens her pace and raises her voice, before yelling the final word.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>If you come near me, I will do something I might regret.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>She speaks quickly and in a level tone, while making direct eye contact with you.&nbsp;</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>I swear to God. If you don&rsquo;t get me your fucking manager right fucking now, I will lose my shit and it will ALL. BE. YOUR. FAULT!&nbsp;</p>
