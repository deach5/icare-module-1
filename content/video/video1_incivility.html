        <p>A woman in her 30s is waiting outside the entrance to the zoo. She has long blonde hair and is wearing a brown t-shirt. She is shown from the waist up and is looking straight at you. She has a stern expression on her face and
            frequently switches her stance between having her arms crossed and looking impatiently around her and at her phone.</p>
